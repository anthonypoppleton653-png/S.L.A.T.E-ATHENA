# S.L.A.T.E. Experimental Open Source License (EOSL-1.0)

**Version 1.0 -- February 2026**

## Copyright and Ownership

Copyright (c) 2024-2026 Daniel Perry. All Rights Reserved.

S.L.A.T.E. (Synchronized Living Architecture for Transformation and Evolution) is the sole intellectual property of Daniel Perry, a retired Canadian Forces Veteran and Afghanistan Veteran who served with the PPCLI Battlegroup on Task Force 3-09.

## Preamble

This license is designed to encourage open experimentation, community contribution, and local-first AI development while ensuring fair compensation to the creator and contributors when the software or its derivatives generate significant commercial revenue.

SLATE was built as a one-person project with AI assistance, powered by local hardware. The creator accepts hardware donations (DGX units, GPUs, compute resources) to expand the local processing layer so that users benefit from stronger local AI infrastructure without cloud dependency.

## 1. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms of this license, you are granted the following rights:

### 1.1 Open Use (FREE)

You may freely:

- **Use** S.L.A.T.E. for personal, educational, research, or non-commercial purposes
- **Study** the source code to learn from it
- **Modify** the code for your own use
- **Fork** the repository and create derivative works
- **Distribute** copies and derivative works under the same EOSL-1.0 license
- **Contribute** improvements back to the project via pull requests

### 1.2 Commercial Use (Conditional)

You may use S.L.A.T.E. commercially (in products, services, or internal tools that generate revenue) subject to the following conditions:

#### Small-Scale Commercial Use (FREE)
If your annual gross revenue derived from or substantially enabled by S.L.A.T.E. or its derivatives is **less than $1,000,000 USD**, no payment is required. You must retain attribution (see Section 4).

#### Large-Scale Commercial Use (Fair Compensation Required)
If your annual gross revenue derived from or substantially enabled by S.L.A.T.E. or its derivatives **equals or exceeds $1,000,000 USD**, the following **progressive** compensation schedule applies:

| Revenue Band | Rate | Applied To | Example at $30M |
|-------------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| First $1M | 0% (free) | $0 - $1,000,000 | $0 |
| $1M - $5M | 2% | Next $4,000,000 | $80,000 |
| $5M - $25M | 3% | Next $20,000,000 | $600,000 |
| Above $25M | 5% | Remaining revenue | $250,000 |
| | | **Total at $30M** | **$930,000** |

**Progressive formula**: Royalties are calculated on each band independently (like income tax brackets), NOT on total revenue. Only the portion of revenue within each band is taxed at that band's rate.

```
Royalty = 0% * min(R, $1M)
       + 2% * max(0, min(R, $5M)  - $1M)
       + 3% * max(0, min(R, $25M) - $5M)
       + 5% * max(0, R - $25M)

Where R = Annual SLATE-derived revenue in USD
```

**Worked examples**:

| Annual SLATE-Derived Revenue | Royalty Owed | Effective Rate |
|-----------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| $500,000 | $0 | 0.0% |
| $1,000,000 | $0 | 0.0% |
| $3,000,000 | $40,000 | 1.3% |
| $5,000,000 | $80,000 | 1.6% |
| $10,000,000 | $230,000 | 2.3% |
| $25,000,000 | $680,000 | 2.7% |
| $50,000,000 | $1,930,000 | 3.9% |
| $100,000,000 | $4,430,000 | 4.4% |

**"SLATE-derived revenue"** means revenue directly attributable to products or services that incorporate, depend on, or are substantially enabled by S.L.A.T.E. code, architecture, or derivative works. Revenue from products that merely coexist with SLATE (e.g., a company uses SLATE internally but sells unrelated products) is excluded.

The **Creator Fund** is managed by Daniel Perry and allocated as follows:
- 60% to the project creator (Daniel Perry)
- 25% to the Contributor Compensation Pool (see CONTRIBUTORS.md)
- 15% to project maintenance, infrastructure, and hardware expansion

Payment terms: Annual, within 90 days of fiscal year end, with auditable records.

## 2. Contributor Compensation

### 2.1 Contributor Pool

25% of all commercial royalties are allocated to the **Contributor Compensation Pool**, distributed to qualifying contributors based on objective analysis of their contributions.

### 2.2 Qualification

To qualify for contributor compensation, a contributor must:

1. Have merged pull requests accepted into the official SLATE repository
2. Maintain an established fork with meaningful enhancements (not trivial forks)
3. Have contributions that demonstrably improve code quality, features, documentation, or security

### 2.3 Compensation Methodology

Contributor shares are calculated using objective, automated metrics:

| Metric | Weight | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Lines of Code** (non-trivial) | 25% | Net productive LOC added/modified |
| **Test Coverage Impact** | 20% | Coverage delta from contributions |
| **Issue Resolution** | 15% | Issues closed via merged PRs |
| **Code Review Activity** | 15% | Reviews provided on others' PRs |
| **Documentation** | 10% | Docs, specs, wiki contributions |
| **Security Contributions** | 10% | Vulnerability reports, security fixes |
| **Community Impact** | 5% | Discussion answers, mentoring, support |

Shares are recalculated quarterly using git history, GitHub API data, and the SLATE contribution analysis tools.

### 2.4 Fork Maintainer Compensation

Established fork maintainers who create and maintain high-quality forks with original enhancements are eligible for additional compensation:

| Fork Quality Tier | Additional Share |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Gold** (50+ stars, active maintenance, original features) | 2x base share |
| **Silver** (20+ stars, regular updates, useful modifications) | 1.5x base share |
| **Bronze** (active maintenance, meaningful contributions) | 1x base share |

Fork quality is assessed quarterly using the SLATE fork analysis tools (`slate/slate_fork_sync.py --analyze`).
