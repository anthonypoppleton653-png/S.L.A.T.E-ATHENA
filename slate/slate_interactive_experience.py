"""
SLATE Interactive Experience Engine
====================================

A choose-your-own-adventure style interface for software development.
Based on human psychology and AI inference to create an engaging,
game-like experience for controlling the development lifecycle.

Design Principles:
1. Exploration before commitment - users can learn without acting
2. Branching dialogue trees - multiple paths, not linear steps
3. AI companion guidance - contextual recommendations and explanations
4. Consequence previews - see what happens before you choose
5. Progress visualization - visual maps of development state
6. Psychological engagement - reward loops, discovery, agency

Inspired by:
- RPG dialogue systems (Mass Effect, Baldur's Gate)
- Skill trees (Path of Exile, Civilization tech trees)
- Interactive fiction (Twine, Choice of Games)
- Roguelike progression (Hades, Slay the Spire)
